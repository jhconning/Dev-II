## Jupyter Notebooks for Development Economics Seminar

This repository houses jupyter notebooks and other content used to build the course site for [2020 Economics
 Development II PhD seminar](https://dev-ii-seminar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) taught at CUNY's Graduate Center. 

[Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) allow the mix of markdown text, math equations, and code for interactive simulation, visualization and data analysis in languages such as python, Stata, or R. For a guide to jupyter notebooks and their application in Economics, including how to set things up to create and run notebooks interactively on your own machine or in the cloud visit the [QuantEcon.py](https://quantecon.org/quantecon-py/) site. 

 The notebooks in this collection, first developed for a Spring 2016 version of this course and then extended in 2018 and 2020 range in degree of quality from 'very rough notes' to more polished. This is less a coherent sequential collection of lecture notes and more idiosyncratic collection of topics that seemed amenable to presentation this way. They complement separate class lecture slides to show how key diagrams are constructed and/or to allow interactive exploration and extension of economic models and data analyses.

### How to view and run these jupyter notebooks

----------------------------------------------

 Jupyter notebooks can also be easily converted to render the content in different ways including as static HTML, PDF, and as interactive notebooks that can be run on your local machine or on a cloud server. 

The table below lists the jupyter notebooks in the collection. Click on a link to get a quick static views of the notebook content on github. If you plan to only browse the content without interaction you may prefer the HTML rendering at [the Dev-II course site](https://dev-ii-seminar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).  You can also run the python jupyter notebooks in this repository interactively in the cloud using Google Colab by clicking [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/jhconning/Dev-II) and then selecting the notebook by name.

Coming soon:  ability to run the notebooks via cloud app (via heroku).
