This is a rough assembly of reading and
lecture notes on development microeconomics topics all written
as interactive jupyter notebooks. The content can be read in a variety of ways. You can read them in styled but static `webpages`_ form or as a `PDF book`_ (via the readthedocs service) or you can run them interactively on a `MS Azure jupyter notebook server`_ to allow you to interact with code and widgets.  If you know how to run your own jupyter notebook server with a python kernel you can also just clone/download content from the github repo: https://github.com/jhconning/Dev-II

This is *very* preliminary content, much of it quick first draft form.  Over time I'll try to improve the posted drafts.
